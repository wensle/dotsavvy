      "\n",
      "The DOT Framework is a research strategy for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) that aims to develop a mixed-method design for HCI. It identifies two domains of study for HCI professionals, namely the application domain and the domain of available work. The framework also identifies three trade-offs in research design: rigor vs. relevance, certainty vs. completeness, and inspiration vs. data. It replaces the distinction between qualitative and quantitative research with five research strategies: exploratory, descriptive, explanatory, evaluative, and design research. The DOT Framework aims to optimize the certainty of outcomes through controlled experimentation and involves the use of \"showroom methods\" which make specific work more reusable by other researchers. It can be used as a planning and reflection tool for research and as a tool to achieve common ground in multidisciplinary projects (Turnhout2014 pages 2-3, 3-4, 4-5; Van2013 pages 6-7). It is recommended to use this material at the beginning of the first year of study and can be integrated into a project module (No pages 25-27).\n",

      "The second layer of the DOT Framework is the epistemological trade-offs layer, which identifies three trade-offs between basic values in research design that cannot be optimized simultaneously: rigor and relevance, certainty and completeness, and inspiration-oriented approaches and data-oriented approaches. Researchers need to triangulate these trade-offs by choosing appropriate research strategies. The showroom methods of this layer help make specific work more reusable by other researchers through the creation of design frameworks or guidelines intended to highlight considerations that go beyond individual designs. Examples of discovery-oriented strategies for this layer include case studies, interviews, and surveys, while creation-oriented strategies include prototyping, usability testing, and A/B testing. Examples of showroom methods include explicit comparison of an algorithm's performance with a benchmark and a critique of a finished design in relation to existing work (Turnhout2014).\n",

However, the text does not provide specific examples of research using the DOT-framework. The article by Turnhout et al.

Examples of completeness include triangulation, member checking, and critical testing. Researchers must choose between the trade-off of precision and measurement, which would require laboratory experiments or judgment tasks, or the system character of context, which would use field studies or ethnography instead (Turnhout2014 pages 3-4). Triangulation, a research strategy in the second layer of the DOT Framework, involves combining multiple methods to increase the certainty and completeness of the findings. A triangulation quartet is an example of a tool used to combine data from four sources to provide a more complete and accurate picture (No pages 1-2).\n",

They are a subcategory of research methods that fall under the second layer of the framework, which explores the application domain. An inspiration-oriented approach can be used as a replacement for a field study to explore future use-contexts and can involve experimenter control. The creation of design frameworks or guidelines, which highlight considerations that go beyond individual designs, is also part of inspiration-oriented methods (Van2013 pages 5-5). Examples of inspiration-oriented approaches include an inspiration-oriented lab study that aimed to create representative situations for an application context and test novel insights against the application domain.

Examples of inspiration-oriented approaches include showroom studies, which compare designs that served as inspiration in earlier stages and critique the proposed design, and lab studies that aim to create representative situations for the application context. On the other hand, data-oriented approaches are objective and use empirical data to support their claims. They are concerned with rigor and certainty and view the researcher as an independent observer of reality. Examples of data-oriented approaches include field studies, which use real-world settings to collect data, and pattern recognition algorithms that compare the performance of the algorithm to other approaches to the problem.

However, according to the other sources, No pages 17-22, Turnhout2014 pages 2-3, Van2014 pages 1-2, there is no mention of a definitive list of research methods that the DOT Framework recommends.
