# Data Folder

This folder contains data downloaded from various sources. Each data source will have its own subfolder.

## Structure

- `source1/`: Data files downloaded from source1.
- `source2/`: Data files downloaded from source2.
- `...`: Additional subfolders for other data sources.

## How to Use the Data

1. Run the appropriate script(s) from the `scripts/` directory to download the data for the desired source(s). For example:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/download_data_source1.sh
    ```
